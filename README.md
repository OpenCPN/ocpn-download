OpenCPN plugin downloader README
================================

This is a javascript frontend which enables OpenCPN[1] users to download
plugins.

The primary usecase is a user in a harbour without network access which
takes a laptop to a caf√© in the vicinity, downloads the plugin, carries it
back and installs it.  Some background discussion is available in [2]


## Installation:

   $ git clone https://github.com/leamas/ocpn-download
   $ npm ci
   $ npm run build

The installation creates a directory build which can be served by a static
webserver like apache or nginx.

Note that the default build assumes that the package is served at the root
directory. The build output has more info on this.
